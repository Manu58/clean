# clean the data

This repo contains a jupyter notebook that cleans the noisy data using polars.
It was used with python  3.10.11, but other versions probably will work as well.
Use a virtual environment and
```bash
pip install -r requirements
```
to install polars and jupyter.
Run 
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
and a jupyter server will start in tree view. (or use jupyter lab to start with the lab view).
The notebook guides you through the cleansing.
